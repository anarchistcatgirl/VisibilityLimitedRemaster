# VisibilityLimitedRemaster
Remaster of the original 2D Unity build of Visibility Limited rebuilt in 3D with Unreal Engine 5

I am a programmer who worked on the original which was presented at the 2024 Fall Stout Game Expo at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. Given that I am working on this solo, there is no expected date of release. I intend for this game to be faithful to the original, with some minor tweaks that make it more suited for a 3D environment.
